title: Improve integration installation experience
description: Redesigning the integration installation flow in Dialpad to reduce setup friction, improve admin confidence, and drive faster adoption of connected tools.
problem: Integration setup was long, error-prone, and hidden behind technical jargon, leading to low completion rates and frustrated admins.
solution: We simplified the installation flow with step-by-step guidance, progress indicators, validation checks, and clearer role-based permissions.
metrics: Increased successful installations by 47%, reduced setup time from 12 mins â†’ 6 mins, and improved admin satisfaction scores by +22 NPS.
