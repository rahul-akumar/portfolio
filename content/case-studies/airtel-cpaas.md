title: Airtel CPaaS
description: Complete overhaul of a subscription management platform to improve usability, streamline workflows, and enhance overall user experience. The goal was to create a more intuitive and efficient platform for both administrators and end-users.
problem: We set out to rebuild a legacy feature set into a modern, fast, and accessible experience. The original flow suffered from confusing navigation, slow perceived performance, and inconsistent UI patterns across pages and domain.
solution: We adopted a content-first approach using Markdown for authoring, rendered via Nuxt Content, and a minimal component layer for consistent visuals.
metrics: the best metric moved are.
