title: Dialpad CTI Redesign
description: Redesigning Dialpad’s CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) experience to improve usability, reduce workflow friction, and make calling tools more intuitive for sales and support teams.
problem: The legacy CTI was cluttered, inconsistent across apps, and lacked contextual actions, slowing down call handling and reducing adoption by sales/support teams.
solution: We introduced a modern, lightweight CTI widget with streamlined call controls, contextual CRM actions, and a scalable component system.
metrics: Reduced average call handling time by 22%, increased CTI adoption from 40% → 76% of target users, and improved task completion success rate by +31% in usability tests.

**Sales and support reps struggled with the existing CTI.**  

* Inconsistent UI across web, desktop, and CRM plugins.  
* Cluttered controls led to missed or incorrect actions.  
* No contextual entry points for integrations (CRM logging, notes, etc.).
