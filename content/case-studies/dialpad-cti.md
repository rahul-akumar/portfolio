title: Dialpad CTI Redesign
description: Redesigning Dialpad’s CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) experience to improve usability, reduce workflow friction, and make calling tools more intuitive for sales and support teams.
problem: The legacy CTI was cluttered, inconsistent across apps, and lacked contextual actions, slowing down call handling and reducing adoption by sales/support teams.
solution: We introduced a modern, lightweight CTI widget with streamlined call controls, contextual CRM actions, and a scalable component system.
metrics: Reduced average call handling time by 22%, increased CTI adoption from 40% → 76% of target users, and improved task completion success rate by +31% in usability tests.

<div class="flex flex-col gap-4">

The redesigned CTI **streamlined call handling workflows** and made daily tasks significantly faster.

By focusing on **consistency, contextual actions, and reduced cognitive load**, we achieved higher adoption, faster task completion, and stronger satisfaction across sales and support teams.

Next step: integrate **AI-powered call assistance** (real-time transcription, smart follow-ups, sentiment tracking).
