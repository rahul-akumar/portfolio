title: Improving integration adoption in Dialpad ecosystem
description: Redesigning Dialpad’s sidebar, call pill, and conversation history to surface integrations contextually and increase daily adoption.
problem: Integrations were underutilized due to poor discoverability, buried settings, and lack of contextual entry points in daily workflows.
solution: We introduced a redesigned sidebar, updated call pill UI, and refreshed conversation history to make integrations visible and actionable where users work most.
metrics: Increased integration adoption from 15% → 42% of active orgs, reduced setup friction by 35%, and boosted NPS for integrations by +18.

**Less than 25% of active users engaged with integrations inside Dialpad ecosystem.**

**Over 75% of users preferred to use intgration portal over the sidebar.**

- Majority of users were not aware of the integrations available to them.

- Integrations were hidden in profile panel, not part of users’ natural workflows.

- Existing UI (sidebar, call pill, conversation history) provided no integration visibility or context.
