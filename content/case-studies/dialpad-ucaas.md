title: Improving Integration Adoption in Dialpad ecosystem
description: Redesigning Dialpad’s sidebar, call pill, and conversation history to surface integrations contextually and increase daily adoption.
problem: Integrations were underutilized due to poor discoverability, buried settings, and lack of contextual entry points in daily workflows.
solution: We introduced a redesigned sidebar, updated call pill UI, and refreshed conversation history to make integrations visible and actionable where users work most.
metrics: Increased integration adoption from 15% → 42% of active orgs, reduced setup friction by 35%, and boosted NPS for integrations by +18.

<div class="flex flex-col">

**Less than 25% of active users engaged with integrations.**  

Integrations were hidden in profile panel, not part of users’ natural workflows.  

Existing UI (sidebar, call pill, conversation history) provided no integration visibility or context.
